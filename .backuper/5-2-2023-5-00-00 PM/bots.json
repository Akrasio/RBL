Also we have some COOL features like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Run by awesome devs that would love to answer your questions/Awesome Support.</li>\r\n  <li>99.99%+ Uptime Guarenteed.</li>\r\n  <li>Higher quality bot for a Bad User bot.

Invite our Meowbahh Revolt bot today.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>THE CREATOR OF THIS BOT DOES NOT ENCOURAGE HARASSING OF OTHER PEOPLE!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason we made this bot is because the real Meowbahh loves saying slurs and wishing peoples deaths. Everyone wanted to cancel him (since Meowbahh is exposed for being a man) so I want to spread this awareness that Meowbahh needs to be cancelled for the things he did. If you do not believe me, look up proof on Youtube.</p>",
